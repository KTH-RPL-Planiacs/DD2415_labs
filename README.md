# DD2415 Labs

This repository hosts lab files for the KTH course DD2415. Each lab is a separate Jupyter notebook. For your convenience, we made sure these run in Google Colab, so you can work with the labs without any setup required on your pc. A Google account is required to make changes and save progress. You can also run the notebooks locally, but some require dependencies that need to be built and installed.

### Using Google Colab
When working with the labs in Colab, make sure to create a personal copy of the file first (File -> Save A Copy in Drive) so you keep your progress.


### Docker Setup for running notebooks locally

If you prefer to run tutorials locally using a docker container, you can find the necessary files in the `local_tutorials_container` directory. Instructions are provided in the directory's README file.

You can currently run the following tutorials locally using the docker container:
- Tutorial 4
