# DD2415 Labs

This repository hosts lab files for the KTH course DD2415. Each lab is a separate Jupyter notebook. For your convenience, we made sure these run in Google Colab, so you can work with the labs without any setup required on your pc. A Google account is required to make changes and save progress. You can also run the notebooks locally, but some require dependencies that need to be built and installed.

When working with the labs in Colab, make sure to create a personal copy of the file first (File -> Save A Copy in Drive) so you keep your progress.
