However, it is also rather conservative since the robot stays in the safe halfspace although the obstacle is far away. How can we change that? The key is to consider a timevarying control barrier function that changes whenever the obstacle is moving. In this section we will look into more sophisticated CBFs that will change over time. In this way, we will not only ensure safety but also ensure that our robot reaches its destination!\n",
