    "[Zonotopes](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Zonotope.html) are a special class of convex polytopes. Traditionally, a zonotope is a set of points in $n$-dimensional space constructed from vectors $g_i$ by taking the sum of $x_i v_i$, where each $x_i$ is a scalar between 0 and 1. Different choices of scalars give different points, and the zonotope is the set of all such points. Equivalently, a zonotope is a Minkowski sum of a finite set of line segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we define a zonotope Z as a set such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\Bigg\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\: \\Bigg | \\: x = c + \\displaystyle\\sum^{i=p}_{i=1}x_i g_i,\\quad -1 \\leq x_i \\leq 1 \\Bigg\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c,g_1, \\dots ,g_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We write $Z = (c, <g_1, \\dots,g_p>)$. Note that a zonotope is always centrally symmetric and that the point $c$ is the **center** of $Z$. The collection of vectors $g_1,\\dots,g_p$ is called the set of **generators** of $Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to make use of two interesting properties of zonotopes presented below in order to make our computations efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "But first, let's explore how a zonotope could be represented in code, using the library *pypolycontain*. The zonotope is defined by a center $c$ and three generators:\n",
